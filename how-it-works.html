				<h3>Security</h3>
				<p class="lead">Security is of the uttermost importance to us because it is of the uttermost importance to you.</p>
				<p>We store all your files in secure indices, ensuring a strict no-access rule for all your data.<br />
				All traffic between your servers and ours is encrypted using SSL.</p>

				<p>A chaos-monkey script runs continuously trying to breach our system, ensuring your data-policies are correctly applied.</p>

				<p>Finally, your original document is never stored on a hard drive: we only keep it in RAM for the duration of our analysis, then discard the file and only keep our secured index data: <span class="highlight">you remain the sole owner of the original document</span>.</p>
