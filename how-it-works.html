						<h2>Providers</h2>
						<p>Implementing a search engine is way too complicated and requires true expertise. This service must be reliable at any time and is reliant of its sources. It requires a lot of iterations to tune it perfectly and provide a key features for your employees.
					Despite the search algorithms you must be able to gather, filter, shape and store the data you want to search through. You will have to respond quickly to all changes made to your sources APIs.
						Upgradability and reusability make a search engine very expensive to build and maintain.</p>

						<h2>Integration</h2>
						<p>As IT is moving to the cloud, enterprise search has gone obsolete. Buying software and maintaining it is from another age. But legacy services are still here and have to be taken into consideration. Cloud and legacy services have to cohabitate in a new way, that enables tangible value creation for the end user.
						We have always focused on upgradability, maintainability, availability, efficiency and reusability to deliver a plug-and-play solution that you can ship and make profitable as soon as you give it a try.</p>

				<h3>Sécurity</h3>
				<p class="lead">We search trough emails, files, cloud services, local applications. This takes time and is mostly inefficient. In a business context, the relevant information is not where we expect it to be. The last email may never contain the google drive or dropbox link that you need. You may also not know what to search and you do not want to spend time searching for it. <span class="highlight">That is why information has to come to us firsthand, without search.</span></p>
