				<p class="lead">We search trough emails, files, cloud services, local applications. This takes time and is mostly inefficient. In a business context, the relevant information is not where we expect it to be. The last email may never contain the google drive or dropbox link that you need. You may also not know what to search and you do not want to spend time searching for it. <span class="highlight">That is why information has to come to us firsthand, without search.</span></p>
