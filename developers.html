				<h2>Buy</h2>
				<p>As IT is moving to the cloud, enterprise search has gone obsolete. Buying software and maintaining it is from another age. But legacy services are still here and have to be taken into consideration. Cloud and legacy services have to cohabitate in a new way, that enables tangible value creation for the end user.
					We have always focused on upgradability, maintainability, availability, efficiency and reusability to deliver a plug-and-play solution that you can ship and make profitable as soon as you give it a try.</p>
